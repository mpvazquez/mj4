###Objectives
Our team of Junior Web Developers set out to hardroll this online version of **Scattergories** for everyone to enjoy. This application is currently in its first iteration, and we hope to come back and do some more work on it in the future after our time at General Assembly. We built this after a one week sprint using an Agile software development process.
